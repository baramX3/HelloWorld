We want to clarify that this is just text.

## This is a header

I forgot to add some text here

### This is a smaller header

This is just text

Also it would be nice to add a list. Here we go:

1. Apples
2. Oranges
3. Bananas
4. Music

Formatting information before:
*Italics*
~~I do not like coding~~
***This is both italics and bold***
**This is bold with a _word_ only italics**

Let's make a table:

| This | is | a | table | header |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| this | is | the | table's | content |
| More | content | is | shown | here |
| add | two |

Note that the first line of the "table" is just a header. You need another row to actually render a table.
